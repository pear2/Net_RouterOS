* Util::get() and Util::find() no longer treat numeric arguments as numbers, but instead treat them as literals to pass to the router. This means that items with names that resemble numbers can now be targeted.
* Util::find() no longer processes comma separated lists recursively. Instead, they are included in the result after a normalization. This means that items with names that are also the names of callbacks can be targeted by simply adding a "," at the end of the name.
* Different response properties can now be streamed depending on a threshold, instead of "all or nothing", as was before.
* ResponseCollection::toArray() now accepts a bit mask of ResponseCollection::ARRAY_\* constants, which allow the use of indexes (uses 1 for compatibility), and the new recursive option, which allows getting the individual responses serialized as a plain array.
* Doc fixes.
